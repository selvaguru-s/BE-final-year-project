<h3>ABSTRACT</h3><br>
 The amount of data generated by the current interconnected world is
immeasurable, and a large part of such data is publicly available, which means that
it is accessible by any user, at any time, from anywhere in the Internet. Our Moto is
to find these available information with the help of Open Source Intelligence.
Which is used for pre cyber attack stage like reconnaissance and attack stimulation
and post cyber attack like foot printing. In this respect, Open Source Intelligence
(OSINT) is a type of intelligence that actually benefits from that open nature by
collecting, processing and correlating points of the whole cyberspace to generate
knowledge. These data's are collected through active reconnaissance and passive
reconnaissance attack Technique. Mostly these data's are used for cyber attack
stimulation. To prevent those attack ,the sensitive data's should be find and
diagnosed. Upload any statement relating the interest.The proposed system consists
of multiple information gathering tools. These tools Accurately give the victim
details which is present in the social media .Our system is designed to accessed
through the internet with the help of web browser. Less human effort is needed
.High data confidentiality .Less time consumption .Upload any statement relating
the interest.
